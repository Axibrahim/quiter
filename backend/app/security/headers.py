Flask-Talisman configuration — HSTS, CSP, and secure-header hardening.

Everything here is deny-by-default: we explicitly allowlist the exact CDN
hosts the frontend uses (Three.js, GSAP, Lenis, Google Fonts) rather than
using 'unsafe-inline' or wildcard sources. A wildcard or 'unsafe-inline'
script-src would silently defeat the entire point of having a CSP, since it
re-permits the #1 XSS payload vector (inline <script> injection).
